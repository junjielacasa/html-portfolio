<h2>    My Top 3 Movies of all time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3> 1. <i> THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO</i></h3>
<p>
    At the age of nineteen, Edmond Dantès seems to have the perfect life. He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Mercédès, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Dantès’s so-called friends. Danglars, the treasurer of Dantès’s ship, envies Dantès’s early career success; Fernand Mondego is in love with Dantès’s fiancée and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Caderousse is simply envious that Dantès is so much luckier in life than he is.    
</p>
<p>
    Together, these three men draft a letter accusing Dantès of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Dantès is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Dantès himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Dantès is arrested for his alleged crimes.
</p>
<p>
    The deputy public prosecutor, Villefort, sees through the plot to frame Dantès and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Dantès jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Noirtier, is Villefort’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Villefort decides to send Dantès to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Monsieur Morrel, Dantès’s kind and honest boss, Dantès is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.
</p>
<p>
    While in prison, Dantès meets Abbé Faria, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Faria teaches Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Faria also bequeaths to Dantès a large treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Faria dies, Dantès hides himself in the abbé’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Dantès is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.

<h3>2. <i>  MAJARAJA</i> </h3>

<p>
    This allows me to experience the film without preconceived notions. However, Maharaja was an exception. At midnight, one of my friends asked me to watch it. Then, in the morning, yet another friend asked me to check it out, saying, “Hey Jainam, this is a film you should check out for storytelling and directing,” and it was straight up addressed to me as I aspire to be a film maker someday. Then, yet another friend from the same circle praised it. And then a few other friends pinged me to watch it. And this was completely coincidental. And this kind of made me a little too excited because, even though I don’t usually go with reviews as I believe that sets a false image, this film felt different. Maybe because I’ve seen Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap and I know the potential there could be. So, it was time to check out Maharaja.  
</p>

<p>
    From the outset, “Maharaja” is a perplexing enigma. Its non-linear narrative, akin to the structure of “Memento” or “Following,” initially left me questioning the film’s coherence. The disjointed timeline created an atmosphere of confusion, which I initially attributed to a misguided attempt at imitating Christopher Nolan. Yet, as the story progressed, I found myself captivated by the intricate puzzle unfolding before me.
</p>
<p> 
    The first half is a masterclass in suspenseful world-building. Vijay Sethupathi’s character, with his rigid demeanor, is unexpectedly humorous. The absurdity of his obsession with a dustbin is a stroke of genius, as it serves as a stark contrast to the grave themes that emerge later. Anurag Kashyap’s introduction marks a turning point, as the narrative shifts into a darker, more complex territory.
</p>
<p> 
    he film’s core premise—a man’s relentless pursuit of a dustbin—appears trivial at first glance. However, as the plot deepens, the significance of this seemingly mundane object becomes apparent. The police’s initial dismissive attitude toward Maharaja’s obsession is a satirical commentary on bureaucratic indifference. Yet, their subsequent actions introduce a moral dilemma. For any sane person, it’d anyways make no sense to go after a dustbin. So, they weren’t just useless plot devices. Their reactions made sense. Their decision to facilitate Maharaja’s revenge, while undoubtedly illegal, taps into a primal desire for justice. The film deftly explores the blurred lines between law and morality, leaving the audience to grapple with complex questions about vigilantism. Was it unlawful that they let Maharaja kill the rapist? Yes. Do I still support it? 100% yes.
</p>
<p>
    Selvam, Anurag Kashyap’s character, is a complex and tragic figure. His love for his daughter is palpable, yet his actions are reprehensible. The revelation of his heinous crime against his own child is a gut-wrenching moment. The film’s portrayal of his downfall is both chilling and cathartic.
</p>
<p>
    The final scene, with Selvam’s blood on Jothi’s footsteps imprints on the cement, is a powerful visual metaphor for the indelible mark his actions have left on her life.
</p>
<p>
    The ending is bittersweet that reminds me of Denis Villeneuve’s Incendis where we are left with this pit of sadness that even though we’ve decoded every mystery, was the mental trauma for it worth it? “Maharaja” is a testament to that power of storytelling that makes us question morality in ourselves. The film’s ability to blend humor, suspense, and social commentary into a cohesive narrative is commendable. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap delivering career-best performances. Natarajan Subramaniam’s portrayal of Inspector Varadharajan is a revelation, showcasing the actor’s range and depth.
</p>
<p>
    The film’s technical aspects are equally impressive. The editing is sharp and precise, contributing significantly to the film’s non linear and engaging nature. The action sequences are brutal and visceral, serving to heighten the emotional impact of the story.
</P>
<p>
    <b>“Maharaja”</b> is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It is a cinematic experience that challenges, provokes, and ultimately satisfies. With its thought-provoking themes, exceptional performances, and masterful storytelling, “Maharaja” is a must-watch for any cinephile. I believe it really is one of the best films I’ve seen this year so far.
